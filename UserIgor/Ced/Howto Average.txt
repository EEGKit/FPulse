How to make a moving average with alignment. 

Select a file and open it.
Click on any datasection to view it.

Set the evaluation cursors and the peak direction for channel 0 and for channel 1.
You might try 'autoset cursors' ( once for each channel) for this purpose .

If fitting is not desired then switch it off by unchecking all Fit check boxes.


Set Average Align to 'R5'  (RiseTime50%) in channel 0.
Set MovAv to the desired number of data sections to be added for 1 result trace.

Check Draw selection.
Select RT50 and Peak in channel 0
Select Peak in channel 1

Check Table selection.
Select DS, RT50_Y and Peak in channel 0
Select Peak in channel 1

Select some data sections by a 'Left Mouse Control Click' on data section  or 
select all  data sections by a 'Left Mouse Click' on column header (Frm or Sw).

Do  'Analysis'  *AND*  'Averaging'  by  'Right mouse AltGr Shift click' on any data section.
The accompanying analysis is mandatory as in this step the required Alignment time is computed.
