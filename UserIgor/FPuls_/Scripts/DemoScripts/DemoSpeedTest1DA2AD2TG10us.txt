// Purpose:	check if system is capable to sample the desired number of AD with the desired sample rate
//			the advantage of this script is that	
//			1. that it allows multiple sample rates
//				the ramp time 1108.800 ms allows sample intervals of 10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21,22,24,25,28,30,32,36,40,50 us

//			2. that possible sampling errors are detected easily and immediately
// Usage:	
//			Copy this script using 'Save as'
//			Edit the script by selecting the desired AD channels, telegraph channels and sample rate
//			Adjust the number frames so that the total duration approximately matches your real protocol
//				or use integral multiples of the given ramp time 	 
//				If you increase the number of frames you will have to decrease the automatic increment proportionally to avoid an overrange
//			Connect DAC0 to all used ADC channels, connect telegraph channel(s) to the AxoPatch or another suitable source
//			To achieve maximum speed:
//				turn (most or all) acquisition windows off, turn 'timing statistics' on, 
//				turn  'Display all data even when lagging'	 off 
//				turn  'High resolution during acquisition'	 off 
//				turn  'Quick check (after acq, TG)'	on
//				turn  'Show timing statistics'		on
//			'Start'  the acquisition
//			Watch out for warnings or errors displayed in Igors history window
//			Watch the 'Duty' indicator, it should stay below 80%
//			After the acquistion:
//				Look for irregularities in the 'Quick check' window 
//				'Display raw data'  and look for irregularities
//				'ReadCfs' , 'Protocol', 'Current Acq' : look for irregularities
