// Purpose:	verify that ReadCfs recognizes the Protocol/Block/Frame/Sweep structure correctly
//			verify the superimposing works
// Usage:	
//			Supply a ramp voltage  from appr. 0V  to appr. 9V lasting about  6s  to Adc0
//			Set Protocols = 1
//			Record the first third of just one ramp starting at appr. 0V  by starting the script
//			Set Protocols = 3
//			Record the complete ramp starting at appr. 0V  by starting the script
//			Read the data with ReadCfs and test different view and superimpose modes.
//			Check that the Protocol/Block/Frame/Sweep structure is recognized correctly.
