It is possible to move any control panel out of the 'grabbing range'. 
A narrow margin of the panel will be visible but it can no longer be accessed and can not 
be moved back onto the screen. The cure is to first minimize the panel 
(using the checkbox xxx), then then to close it forcefully by clicking the panel close 
button 5 times in fast succession, and finally to open it using the checkbox again.

To select a file for analysis:
Buttons  'Current acq' , 'Select file' , '< prev file'  and  'Next file >'

To make an average:
Right mouse click in the data sections listbox.
Related controls:
'Disp Average' , Erase Avg' , 'save avg'
The average is automatically saved when a new file is opened for analysis.
The file name for the average file is automatic. 
It consists of the analysis file name to which  # <index of average> _ch <index of ch> .avg
is added. 
The <index of average> is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,....x,y,z so a maximum 
of 36 different averages can be averaged for each analysis file.
The automatic file name without channel index and without .avg is displayed in the panel.
The  <index of ch> is 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. It is *not* the true channel number.
The number of traces contained in the current average is displayed in the panel.

How to make a moving average with alignment. 

Select a file and open it.
Click on any datasection to view it.

Set the evaluation cursors and the peak direction for channel 0 and for channel 1.
You might try 'autoset cursors' ( once for each channel) for this purpose .

If fitting is not desired then switch it off by unchecking all Fit check boxes.

Set Average Align to 'R5'  (RiseTime50%) in channel 0.
Set MovAv to the desired number of data sections to be added for 1 result trace.

Check Draw selection.
Select RT50 and Peak in channel 0
Select Peak in channel 1

Check Table selection.
Select DS, RT50_Y and Peak in channel 0
Select Peak in channel 1

Select some data sections by a 'Left Mouse Control Click' on data section  or 
select all  data sections by a 'Left Mouse Click' on column header (Frm or Sw).

Do  'Analysis'  *AND*  'Averaging'  by  'Right mouse AltGr Shift click' on any data section.
The accompanying analysis is mandatory as in this step the required Alignment time is computed.

How to average a result table column
	Right Click on the column header of any result table column
	Select from the context menu
	The averaged value is printed in the history
	Nans are excluded from averaging (normal)  or can be set to 0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to make 1 average over all selected data units (in contrast to a moving average)
	Right Click on the column header of the appropriate Data Sections listbox column
	Select from the context menu

How to make a data movie
	Open a xxx.dat file
		If you want to use the data movie as an inset in a cell movie then now
		shrink the data window size to the desired size.
		It is still possible to adjust the size later when combining the the 2 movies in QuickTime 
		but doing so may result in a severe loss of quality.
	
060821******************	
	View any data section to erase the empty textbox frame
		Click on any data section in the 'Data sections' panel (usually in thr 'Frm' column)
		The data trace will appear in the evaluation window
		Double click on the empty textbox frame
		In the 'Modify annotation' control panel 'Frame', set the foreground color to white and press 'Change'

	Erase the cursors
		Double-click on an empty space in the evaluation window
		The 'Modify trace appearance' control panel will pop up.
		In the trace listbox select all cursor traces (these are the traces starting with 'wc_' )
		Set the color to white and press 'Do It'
******************	

	Select the channel in the main evaluation panel
		Select the desired channel tab in the main evaluation panel (if there is more than 1 channel)
		Uncheck the  'Autoscl Y'  checkbox
		Set  'Y top'  and  'Y bot'   controls to the desired  Y range
	Select the channel in the  'Movies'  panel
		Open the 'Movies' panel and set the channel 
******************	
	Possibly set the duration of the base interval
		In the  'Movies'  panel set the duration of the base interval if the base value is to be subtracted
		Leave the value  0  or set the value to  0  if no base value is to be subtracted 
******************	

	Select the data units to be included in the movie.
******************	
		If the entire experiment is to be included then select all data units by 'left mouse' click 
******************	
		on the header of the appropriate column of the data sections listbox (usually 'Frm')
		You may have to clear this column first by 'Alt Gr  Shift  left mouse' click on the header
	Construct the movie
		This is done by 'Alt Gr  Shift  left mouse' click on any data section of the column
		The acquisition window will display the selected data units (=traces) giving an impression
		of how the movie will look like.
	View the movie
		Open the  'Movies' panel, select the channel and press 'Movies Play'
		A movie window will appear.
		You can view the movie (or parts of it) by pressing either the panels 'Start' and 'Stop' buttons 
		or by using the control bar at the bottom of the movie window.
		
Notes and limitations:		
	-	You may open multiple instances of a movie for viewing, but when constructing a movie 
		no movie must be open for viewing. 
		All movies open for viewing in Igor will automatically be closed when a new movie is constructed.
		But you also have to make sure that the movie is not open outside of FPulse, 
		e.g. close the movie(s) which you may have viewed with the QuickTime player.
	-	You can only construct one movie at a time. If you want a movie for more than 1 acquisition 
		channel you have to run the 'MakeMovie' procedure multiple times. 
	-	Igor requires a picture rate between 1 and 60 pictures per second 
	-	Although it is possible to make a movie from Blocks or Sweeps it is usually best to 
		construct it from Frames. 
	-	Adjust the frame duration in your script to 18 ... 1000 ms (best is 40 ms ~ 25 pictures / s)
	-	Avoid  P over N  as this will lead to unsatisfactory movies
	-	Avoid  Blanks in the script as they will make time scales inconsistent	 	
	-	Constructing a movie is a time consuming process. Processing 1 movie picture typically takes
		200 ms so the movie construction may typically take 10 times as long as the final movie will last.


	Insert the data movie	into the cell movie
		The following instructions are taken from	
			http://helpqt.apple.com/qthelpwr3/english/quicktimehelp/pgs2/qtFmSet4.htm

			With QuickTime Pro, you can place multiple video tracks in the same window 
			to play movies side by side or to create a picture-within-a-picture effect.

			To present multiple movies in the same frame:

				1. In QuickTime Player, choose Edit > Select All to select the entire contents of the first [data] movie.
				2. Choose Edit > Copy
				3. Open the second [cell] movie.
				4. Move the playhead to the point at which you want the first [data] movie to begin playing 
					(usually the beginning or end of the original movie), and choose Edit > "Add to Movie."
				5. Choose Window > Show Movie Properties, select the new video track, and click Visual Settings.
				6. Use the Current Size and Layer controls to set the new video to a desired size, location 
					and layer (layers with lower numbers are farther forward, or more "on top").
					For example, for a picture-within-a-picture effect, with the added [data] movie inside 
					the original [cell] movie, make the new movie smaller and assign it a lower layer number.
					Usually it is better not to adjust the size here but earlier in the data movie creation phase.
				7. Close the Visual Settings panel.
				8. Save the movie.
